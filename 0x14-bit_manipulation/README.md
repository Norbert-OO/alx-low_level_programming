0X14. C - Bit manipulation.

General objectives 
1. Look for the right source of information without too much help
2. How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.

File main.h- is the header file containing all the prototypes of this project.

File 1- A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

File 2- A function that prints the binary representation of a number.

File 3- A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

File 4- A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

File 5- A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

File 6- A function that checks the endianness.

File 7- File contains the password for this program.
